# 🕹 OpenWii

Play the Wii with your phone...

A browser tab on your computer shows a Wii menu. Scan the QR code on screen and
your phone becomes the remote: swing it and a hand cursor sweeps across the
screen. Point at a channel, press A, and you're slicing fruit. No app, no
console, no extra hardware. Up to **four phones** can join the same screen.

> [!TIP]
> Drop this repo into Claude Code or any AI coding agent and ask it questions:
> how the pointer learns your grip, or how a folder becomes a channel. It's a
> small codebase and it explains itself well.

## Run it

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

1. On macOS the server auto-opens Chrome at **https://localhost:8443/** in a
   dedicated profile. Elsewhere, open that URL yourself (`NO_OPEN=1` skips the
   auto-open).
2. Scan the QR code with your phone on the same Wi-Fi and accept the
   certificate warning once.
3. Tap **Enable motion sensors** and swing. There is no calibration step: the
   pointer learns your phone's gyroscope conventions from the first second of
   motion, whatever way you hold it.

On the remote: **A** is the action button, **B** or **⌂** goes back to the
menu, **− / +** adjusts pointer speed, **1** re-centres the cursor. The mouse
drives the cursor whenever no phone is connected, so every game stays playable
on its own (`HTTP=1 npm start` for a quick mouse-only server).

> [!WARNING]
> **HTTPS is not optional, and it's the #1 thing that breaks.** Browsers gate
> motion sensors behind a secure context, and Chrome enforces it *silently*:
> listeners attach, no error is thrown, and events never fire. That's why
> `npm start` serves HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. If the cursor won't
> move, check the phone is on the `https://` address before anything else.

## How it works

    phone["📱 Phone<br/>a web page acting as the Wii remote<br/><code>public/controller.*</code>"]
    relay["🔀 Node relay<br/>forwards packets, tags players P1 to P4<br/><code>server.js</code>"]
    browser["🖥 Browser tab<br/>Wii menu + games + motion engine<br/><code>public/menu.js · games/ · core/</code>"]
    phone -- "motion 60/s + buttons" --> relay
    relay -- "same stream, slot-tagged" --> browser
    browser -. "rumble, per player" .-> phone
```

The interesting part is `core/pointer.js`. A real Wii needs an IR sensor bar to
know where the remote points; OpenWii replaces it with pure software. The
engine learns each phone's gyro axis conventions from its own data at runtime
(they genuinely differ between devices), heals drift back toward the true pose
between swings, and dead-reckons the cursor slightly ahead of the packet
stream so it never feels laggy.

## The games

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🍉 **Fruit Ninja** | Swing the phone like a sword. Slice fruit, dodge bombs. Up to 4 blades on one board. | [`games/fruit-ninja`](games/fruit-ninja) |
| 👾 **Alien Attack** | Lay the phone flat like a tray: roll it to fly, press A to fire. Endless saucer waves, three lives. | [`games/alien-attack`](games/alien-attack) |
| 🎯 **Shooting Range** | Sixty seconds of pop-up targets. Point and press A; the small ones pay five times the big ones. | [`games/shooting-range`](games/shooting-range) |
| 🎨 **Sketch** | Point at the canvas, press A to put the pen down, press again to lift. Ten colors, three brushes, an eraser. | [`games/drawing`](games/drawing) |

Fruit Ninja is the most developed of the four, with multiplayer, criticals,
and combos. Five more experiments (swordplay, table tennis, golf, island
flyover, kart) still live in `games/`: they are hidden from the menu with
`"hidden": true` in their `game.json`, but each remains playable at its
`/games/<slug>/` URL.

## Adding a game

Drop a folder into `games/` with an `index.html`. The server discovers it on
boot and the menu grows a channel; there is no registry to edit.

```
games/your-game/
  index.html     loads socket.io + your game.js
  game.json      { title, tagline, emoji }   ← optional, for the channel card
  logic.js       your rules, kept free of rendering so they test headlessly
  game.js        your renderer
```

`core/channel.js` gives you a calibrated pointer, the player link, and the home
button in a few lines; see any of the games for the pattern. `game.json` also
takes `order` (lower comes first on the menu) and `hidden`.
